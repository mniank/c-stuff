                                       One Shot for a lot 0.7

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##  Programmed in C, with the SDL library. Music by Alexander Brandon. ##


-    Goal : Each ball must reach its targets, which are in the same color, in only one shot.

-    A ball can bounce up to 5 times, but can also be absorbed by walls, or make a U-turn.
     As you progress through the game, you will discover the unique characteristics of each level. It's
  your job to control them.

-    To play, point your cursor to give the initial trajectory of your ball. A click will then allow it
  to go. For higher levels, you will have to give all trajectories before being able to see the action
  begin.
      Warning : when a ball is still in move, it is necessary to wait until the end of the action before
  being able to launch another ball or to do anything.

-    When you complete a level, it is necessary to press ENTER to move to the next level and save your
  progress. You can of course, at any time, try this level again from the main menu, which can be joined
  using the ESC key.

-    Throughout the game you will see your score increase. Once the game finished, your score will be
  locked. The more it will be low, the more you will have made a good score and the more your score will
  be good, the more bonus levels you will have unlocked.

-    The RESET function, found at the bottom of the menu, allow you to reset your score. But will also
  get you back to level 1. This will be necessary if you want to do a better score.

-    You can toggle between full screen mode and windows mode by pressing F1, mute the game with P or
  quit with F4.
