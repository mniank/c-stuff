# c-stuff
C games (using SDL) I wrote when I was a kid

# Lightcat
- Just an update done on my very first C program (after tutorials of course)
- You can just move around with arrow keys and do stuff with SPACE, A and Backspace

# Chess
- You can play PvP
- You can play against an AI (answering in a few seconds)
- You can save and replay a game

# Démineur (Minesweeper)
- A minesweeper
- When you start the game, it asks you for a seed
- The first number of the seed determines the difficulty

# Démineur 3D (Minesweeper in 3D)
- Like the 2D version, but in 3D

# One Shot for a Lot
- A complete game
- Very hard (I bet you can't beat it without cheating)
- The game is very slow (because SDL is)
- You can see the game being beaten by running "Test for a lot - realtime.exe" found in utils/

# Pentaction
- 5 mini games following each other
- Only 3 games are totally implemented (I think)
- Music by V. Bergeron.

# Evolution
- A simulation of animal/species evolution
- Initially started for my TIPE

# GP
- Finds a solution to a problem using genetic algorithm
- My TIPE (2011/12)
- More details in the available docs
